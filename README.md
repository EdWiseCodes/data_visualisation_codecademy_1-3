# data_visualisation_codecademy_1-3
As part of the Codecademy Data Science course, I was tasked with creating visualisations based on life expectancy and GDP data taken from the World Bank and World Health Organisation. The project is intended as an opportunity to demonstrate data preparation and visualisation skills. 

The goal of my project is to answer whether life expectancy and GDP have improved over time, whether country of birth or when you were born is more important for determining life expectancy and GDP, and whether GDP and life expectancy are correlated.

More specifically, the project will seek to answer these four questions:
1. To what extent has life expectancy improved over time, both on average and by country?
2. To what extent has GDP improved over time, both on average and by country?
3. Is your country of birth or when you were born more important for determining your life expectancy? What about the GDP of the nation you live in?
4. To what extent are GDP and life expectancy correlated? Does GDP matter independent of your country of birth in determining your life expectancy?

The data comes from the following sources:
- GDP Source: [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD) national accounts data
- Life expectancy Data Source: [World Health Organization](http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.688)
